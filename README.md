## üìã Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)
-   Basic knowledge of how to work with APIs and environment variables.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Angad2005/Hacky.git](https://github.com/Angad2005/Hacky.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Hacky
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install django flask flask-cors google-generativeai
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    This project requires API keys to function correctly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your keys there.

    ```
    API_KEY_GOOGLE=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
    *Note: Ensure the `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent exposing your secret keys.*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Since this project uses both Django and Flask, you will likely need to run both servers.

1.  **To run the Django server:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2.  **To run the Flask microservice:**
    (Assuming your Flask app file is named `app.py`)
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    The Flask service will likely run on a different port, such as `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
